// is a commonly-known, independently-corroborated musical fact — cross
// checked against at least two independent, generally-reliable sources
// (aggregated chord-site/tutorial consensus, not one site's literal
// formatted chart) via web search on 2026-10-05. Chord *names* and
// *progressions* are treated as facts, not copyrightable expression —
// the same reasoning that lets any chord-reference site exist. No lyrics
// or note-for-note transcriptions are bundled here, and nothing is
// scraped from Ultimate Guitar / Songsterr / Hooktheory's TheoryTab DB.
//
// `confidence`:
//   "confirmed"           — multiple independent sources agree closely.
//   "needs-verification"  — sources conflicted on key/chords, or the
//                            progression is unusually complex/jazzy and
//                            we are not confident enough to present it
//                            as solid. Shown with a visible badge in the

//
// `degreeSequence` is the song's progression written as scale degrees
// (1-7, lowercase-ish intent conveyed via `quality`) in its OWN key —
// this is what Lesson 1's "songs you can already play" payoff screen
// checks against the 1-5-6-4 family (I-V-vi-IV and its rotations, plus
// the same four chords {I, IV, V, vi} in a different order, which is
// the same broader "four chords, a hundred songs" phenomenon).
//
// oneFiveSixFourMatch:
//   "exact"    — the progression is a true cyclic rotation of
//                I-V-vi-IV in the SAME direction (i.e. every chord is
//                followed by the same next chord as in I->V->vi->IV->I
//                — e.g. starting instead at V gives V-vi-IV-I). A loop
//                played in the opposite direction (e.g. vi-V-I-IV) uses
//                the identical four chords but is a genuinely different
//                progression to the ear, not an "exact" match — see
//                `fourChordOrderFamily` below. (An earlier draft of
//                this data incorrectly called two reverse-direction
//                songs — Riptide, The Night We Met — "exact"; fixed
//                after re-deriving each song's chord-to-chord adjacency
//                by hand and catching the error.)
//   "variant"  — uses the same four chords {I, IV, V, vi} but in a
//                functionally different order/direction.
//   false      — does not reduce to that four-chord family.
//
// fourChordOrderFamily (only set on "variant" entries): which of the
// non-Lesson-1 four-chord cyclic orders a song uses, so Lesson 4 (which
// specifically teaches the I-vi-IV-V reordering) can credit only the
// families that actually match it, not every "variant" song generically:
//   "B" — I-IV-vi-V direction (e.g. Riptide, The Night We Met)
//   "C" — I-vi-IV-V direction (e.g. Perfect) — this is what Lesson 4 teaches
//   "D" — I-vi-V-IV direction (e.g. Photograph) — close to Lesson 4's order

  // Sid pasted a 55-song wishlist with suggested chords. Those pasted

  // Am-F-C-G progression was assigned to a suspicious number of unrelated
  // songs, including "Despacito," which has a very different harmonic
  // character on its face; "Shape of You"'s entry had a garbled chord
  // symbol). Every song below was independently re-researched the same
  // way as the original 25 — titles only were taken from the list, not
  // chords. A few pasted guesses turned out to hold up under independent
  // verification anyway (Despacito genuinely does reduce to the 1-5-6-4
  // family once correctly read as Bm-G-D-A in D major — see its entry);
  // most did not, and are marked needs-verification or corrected below.
  //
  // This pass also caught and fixed a real bug in the ORIGINAL 25: two
  // songs (Riptide, The Night We Met) were marked as "exact" 1-5-6-4
  // matches, but re-deriving their chord-to-chord adjacency by hand
  // showed they actually walk the same four chords in the OPPOSITE
  // cyclic direction — a genuinely different-sounding progression, not
  // an exact match. Fixed in those entries above with a correction note.

// and rushing it would mean guessing bridge/pre-chorus chords without
// real confidence. Covered here: 12 of the highest-confidence,
// best-documented songs, prioritizing ones with genuinely well-sourced
// section detail (not just "it's the same 4 chords the whole time"
// restated as fake "structure"). Bar counts are approximate (rounded
// to musically typical phrase lengths — 4 or 8 bars), not pulled from
// a measure-by-measure transcription. No lyrics anywhere, per the
// product's legal scope — sections are labeled structurally only
// ("Chorus," "Bridge"), never with lyric text.
//
// Songs NOT in this map fall back to the existing simple-loop Practice
// view using their top-level `chords` array, looped indefinitely.

//
//   Beginner     — a confirmed, simple 4-chord-family song (an exact or

//                  songs" category this whole app opens with.
//   Advanced     — a jazz standard (genuinely confirmed harmonically
//                  complex while researching that whole batch — see
//                  THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES/README), or a song explicitly
//                  marked `advanced` (Bohemian Rhapsody).
//   Intermediate — everything else: minor-key loops, 7th-chord/8-chord
//                  progressions, and needs-verification songs (if we're
//                  not even confident enough to call its chords solid,
//                  it isn't honest to call it Beginner-simple either).
